    "\n",
    "1) You are **allowed** to look at your class notes and practical sheets. However, do not copy-paste any codes. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Do not take any help either online or from your friends, which will be treated as cheating.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) You are not allowed to use custom python functions for solving problems unless stated otherwise in the problems.  In case of doubt ask the instructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Please write clean codes with sufficient comments. Clumsy codes can reduce your marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Submit two files: a single pdf of the jupyter notebook and the original jupyter notebook file. Before submitting run all the cells again.\n",

    "You throw a tennis ball at an angle of 60 degrees to the ground with a velocity of 30 m/s.  Upon dropping on the ground it rebounds. At each rebound, the tennis ball loses 20% of its current kinetic energy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Plot the trajectory of the tennis ball in the $x$-$y$ plane,starting from origin, where $x$-axis represents the ground plane and $y$-axis as vertical elevation. The plot should show at least four bounces of the ball. \n",

    "In this problem, one has to choose $\\alpha$ in every step in such a way that $x_n$ converges to local minima. For example, using the same value of $\\alpha$ for each step is neither accurate nor efficient. Take a hint from the values of slopes.\n",
